It's a temperature independent voltage reference with transistor only.

## How it works

The LTspice simulation file contains this circuit. The **first transistor stage** is a mixer and oscillator, the **second** is a small and simple amplifier stage. In first stage I use an AF transformer from an old radio (NEYWA 402) for the audio signal, but you can use other type too. Not critical.
